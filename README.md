A demonstration login webpage designed for educational security testing and brute-force attack simulations.

## Live Demo

üîó **[Access the live demo here](https://nicomariio.github.io/mocklogin)**

## Features

- **Realistic Login Interface**: Clean, professional-looking login form
- **Generic Error Messages**: Failed attempts show non-specific error messages (doesn't reveal if username or password is incorrect)
- **Attempt Counter**: Tracks the number of login attempts in real-time
- **Single Valid Account**: One working set of credentials for testing purposes

## Test Credentials

- **Username**: `Admin`
- **Password**: `Admin2012`

## Usage

This demo is designed for:
- Security education and training
- Testing brute-force attack tools and scripts
- Demonstrating web application security concepts
- Learning about login security vulnerabilities

## Security Testing Tools

This demo can be used with various security testing tools such as:
- Burp Suite
- OWASP ZAP
- Custom Python scripts
- Hydra
- Medusa

## Educational Purpose

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This is a controlled environment created specifically for educational and security testing purposes. The intentionally generic error messages demonstrate common security anti-patterns that should be avoided in production applications.
